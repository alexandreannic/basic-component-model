<div class="block"><p>Smoothing pushed data.</p>

<p>
The package <code>fr.upmc.components.examples.smoothing</code> implements an
example that is meant to test the different functionalities of the basic
component model.  The basic idea is to smooth (by averaging) data pushed from
a pair of sensors through filters before pushing them further to the gauges to
be displayed.  Sources are considered as two different sensors to produce what
should be the same data, hence gauges will be paired exchange the values they
receive so they can display their deviation from the other source each time
they display a new value for them.
</p>

<p>
To simulate the sensors, a composite concurrent component
<code>SensorSimulator</code> produces sensor data using random numbers
generated using three internal sequential components, illustrating the
capability of the model to define subcomponents:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Two <code>UniformRNGenerator</code> components that generate uniform random
  numbers, and
</li>
<li>One <code>NormalRNGenerator</code> component that takes two uniform random
  numbers from the components <code>UniformRNGenerator</code>, add compute
  a normal random number from them using the Box-Muller approach, and then
  return the result as a new random number.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The concurrent component <code>SensorSimulator</code> has an internal main task
that produces random numbers at a given time interval and pushes the data
towards two concurrent component <code>Filter</code> that buffer them.
<code>Filter</code> are used by two gauge components
<code>Gauge</code> that get the filtered values from them in pull mode and
prints them on <code>System.out</code>.
The two <code>Gauge</code> are connected through a
two-way interface <code>PairedGaugeI</code> to exchange their most recently
received values.  The following figure illustrates this assembly:
</p>

<p>
See the documentation of the companion basic client/server example to know
all the steps required to go from design to execution of such a component-based
application.  New in this example is the use of data and two way interfaces,
as well as composite components.
</p>

<p>
As an example, random number generation services are defined by the data
interfaces <code>RNGDataOfferedI</code> and <code>RNGDataRequiredI</code>.
Data interfaces in the component model contain three Java interfaces:
</p>
<ol>
<li>a pull interface, used when data are pulled by the client from the
  provider;</li>
<li>a push interface, used when data are pushed by the provider to the
  client; and</li>
<li>a data interface, used to type the data objects that are exchanged by
  the methods of the pull and push interfaces.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The standard <code>DataOfferedI</code> and <code>DataRequiredI</code> defined
in the model proposes pull and push interfaces with methods that can readily
be used 'as is'.  The seldom need to be redefined, though it is still possible
to do so if this appears fruitful for the application (using more meaningful
method names for example).  The two data interfaces defined in the two standard
interfaces however is empty, hence each application of a data exchange
connection must define their own interfaces or at least objects that will be
exchanged.  The simplest way to do so is to define a class that implements
both the <code>DataOfferedI.DataI</code> and the <code>DataRequiredI.DataI</code>
interfaces.  Then, instances of this class will be used both by the provider
and the client to exchange data.  The standard <code>DataConnector</code> can
then be used to connect the ports.  A slightly more complicated case is when
the two application data offered and required interfaces propose their own
data interface extending the ones of the standard interfaces.  Then the class
of the objects that will be exchanged will need to implement these two interfaces
rather than the standard ones.  Beware that data inbound and outbound ports
must implement both the pull and the push interfaces to connect the component
properly and allow the exchanges to be made in the two modes.  However, if
one mode is not used in the application, methods need not do something.
</p>
<p>
If the provider and the client components are developed independently, they
will most probably have their own classes to implement the data interface of
the client (required) and the data interface of the provider (offered)
respectively.  In this case, when a data object is pushed by the provider, it
will need to be transformed into a data object of the client before the latter
can use it.  This is done by the connector by redefining the method
<code>required2offered</code> of the connector.  These methods have standard
definition to simply cast the object to the offered data interface.
</p>

<p>
Two way interfaces are used in the example to connect the gauge so that they
can pull the last displayed value from each other in the same manner.  The
symmetry of the call makes it difficult for the ports and the connector to
forward the call to the correct component, as standard method call do not
identify the caller.  Hence, at this point, all methods in a two way interface
should explicitly pass as argument the caller port, so that when programming
the ports and the connector, the code in the connector can test is the caller
is the offering or requiring side, and the ports can know if the caller is its
owner or not.
</p>

<p>
The component sensor simulator provides an example of a composite component.
A composite component is responsible for the creation, the starting and the
shutting down of its subcomponents.  A strong hypothesis of the model is that
a composite component and all of its subcomponents must reside in the same JVM.
Hence, they are always local.  Furthermore, subcomponents cannot be called
from the outside of the composite, except if the composite makes one of the
subcomponent port visible as one of its own ports.  Subcomponents can therefore
be created as local, and their port only locally published.  They can be created
and interconnected at one in the constructor of the composite component for
example.  Subcomponents are not inserted in the deployed component of the
assembly but rather known as subcomponents of the composite which will be
able to start them or shut them down when itself it is (this is done in the
<code>start</code> and <code>shutdown</code> methods of
<code>AbstractComponent</code>.  Beware that subcomponents must be explicitly
disconnected from each other before they can be shut down, as components are
in the assembly.
</p>

<p>
The single JVM CVM creates components and ports, publishes the ports and
connects the components in the <code>deploy</code> method.  The distributed
CVM uses six JVM to run the application: one for each sensor simulator,
filter and gauge.  Notice that data and two way distant connections must be
made in the two JVM of their distant components.  This is to cater for the
pull and push calls for the data connections, and the peer-to-peer calls in
the two way for the two way connections.
